        <h1>What inspires you to learn?</h1>
        <p>
          I feel like the motivation behind me wanting to learn is improving
          myself so i can become a better person than i was the day before.
          Another reason behind my inspiration is to be more independent because
          by learning skills i would be able to perform them myself without
          assistances. In addition, by improving myself i would be able to help
          other people who need help. Overall, my inspiration behind learning is
          about improving my capabilities and helping others in the process.
        </p>

      <div class="impact">
        <h1>How it impacts you?</h1>
        <p>
          The inspiration to learn impacts me personally, by helping my personal
          growth because it allowing me to enjoy the learning process of new things. It also impacts me by
          making me more curious and helps me develop profound thoughts. Futhermore,
          it helps me look at challenges in a more positive manner, which i feel
          helps me push through harder task that other people may find diffcult.
          Altogether, the imspiration to learn heavily influences, how i view
          obstacles and it helps my personal growth.
