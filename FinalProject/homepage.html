        <h1>What inspires you to learn?</h1>
        <p>
          I feel like the motivation behind me wanting to learn is improving
          myself so i can become a better person than i was the day before.
          Another reason behind my inspiration is to be more independent because
          by learning skills i would be able to perform them myself without
          assistances. In addition, by improving myself i would be able to help
          other people who need help. Overall, my inspiration behind learning is
          about improving my capabilities and helping others in the process.

          growth because allowing me to enjoy learning. It also impacts me by
          making me, curious and help me develop profound thoughts. Futhermore,
          it helps me look at challenges in a more positive manner. Overall, the
          inspiration to learn influences my personal growth and changes my
