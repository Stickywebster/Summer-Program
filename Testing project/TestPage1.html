      I've become A figment of my imagination That's why I run Towards self-love
      and inner restoration Mm-mm, mm I don't know what it is that I'm climbing
      to I hear your words in my head, you said, "The mountain is you" And only
      worry can bring me down I'm scared to let go of what I'm scared to lose
      I'm pouring out myself, I'd give it all for the view And only worry can
      bring me down You said, "The mountain is you" The mountain is you Yep
      Oh-ooh-ooh, ooh Heart and my hands, don't fail me now Won't let the weight
      of my fear go and knock me down Only way's up, no going around Oh You
      called my name in the dead of night I was barely surviving, almost left
      the climb Said, "Don't look down, but open your eyes" You were right, you
      said, "The mountain is you" (ooh) The mountain is you (ooh) You said, "The
      mountain is you" (ooh) The mountain is you (ooh)
